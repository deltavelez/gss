To follow-up on the order of the bytes in SDL.
As it is works, but it may affect support of other platforms

Uint32 getpixel(SDL_Surface *surface, int x, int y)
{
  int bpp = surface->format->BytesPerPixel;
  /* Here p is the address to the pixel we want to retrieve */
  Uint8 *p = (Uint8 *)surface->pixels + y * surface->pitch + x * bpp;

  switch(bpp) {
  case 1:
    return *p;
    break;

  case 2:
    return *(Uint16 *)p;
    break;

  case 3:
    if(SDL_BYTEORDER == SDL_BIG_ENDIAN)
      return p[0] << 16 | p[1] << 8 | p[2];
    else
      return p[0] | p[1] << 8 | p[2] << 16;
    break;

  case 4:
    return *(Uint32 *)p;
    break;

  default:
    return 0;       /* shouldn't happen, but avoids warnings */
  }
}
